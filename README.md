The air waybill is used in the air cargo industry to track shipments.

It uses a *check digit* to validate the air waybill number.

Sometimes, handwritten bills will contain an incorrect, illegible or missing digit.  

This script will test the air waybill number for validity, and if it is invalid will present a list of candidate numbers.

It uses Python 3 for highlighting.
